## Family and Outdoor

```{grid} 1 2 2 2

I am a dad of two.
My wife and I met in Boston, and we enjoys spending time outdoors.
My connection to the outdoors began early.
Growing up in a working-class family in Hong Kong, my father often
took our family hiking and fishing on weekends.
Simple, affordable outings that became some of my fondest memories.
I was a
[Scout](https://www.facebook.com/tw8scout)
as a teenager, where I developed outdoor and leadership skills that
continue to shape how I engage with the outdoors.\
\
After moving to the United States, I continued these activities, often
organizing hiking and camping trips with friends.
In the summer of 2010, I spent two months
[biking across the United States](https://bikexus.blogspot.com/)
between my Harvard ITC Fellowship and my Nordita Fellowship.\
\
Most recently, I joined
[Troop 211 in Arizona](https://www.instagram.com/troop211az),
where my boys are now Scouts, allowing our family to share time
outdoors while passing along practical skills and a spirit of
exploration.
